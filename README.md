# MAI_AdvancedProgramming_ConvexHull
Convex Hull assignment for the course Advanced Programming in Master AI Engineering

This project provides a visualization and benchmarking tool for convex hull algorithms using Python's `pygame` library. It includes implementations of the **Gift Wrapping (Jarvis March)** and **Andrew's Algorithm** for finding the convex hull of a set of 2D points. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all points.

## Features
- **Visual step-by-step construction** of the convex hull using either Gift Wrapping or Andrew's Algorithm.
- **Random point generation** (either scattered or circular) or import points from a file.
- **Benchmarking tool** to compare the performance of different convex hull algorithms with different point distributions.
- **Real-time performance plotting** to visualize algorithm efficiency and hull size.

## Requirements
Make sure to have the following Python packages installed:
- `pygame`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pyparsing`
